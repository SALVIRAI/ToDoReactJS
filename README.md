# ToDoReactJS
A To-Do app that covers all four aspects of a CRUD: Create, Read, Update, and Delete.
This type of project is often done with Class components, but this application will instead integrateÂ React Hooks.
React Hooks allow for functional components to have a state and utilize lifecycle methods, allowing you to avoid using class components and have more modular and readable code.
